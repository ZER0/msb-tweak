An add-on to enable 'draft' and 'todo list' in Mozilla Status Board.

**NOTE**: if you clone the source, you need to have an Add-on SDK with proper
`data.load` method implementation, otherwise you could end up with some problem,
at least on Mac. It should land soon, however you can checkout my
[readURI/Bug748086](https://github.com/ZER0/addon-sdk/tree/readURI/Bug748086)
branch in the meanwhile.
